/* The goal of this program is to demonstrates dynamic arrays, pointers, and doubly linked lists.
 * The program describes a Skip List data structure to store integers. The program starts by doing a
 * O(log n) search through the Skip List for a given item (number in our case), by starting at the top
 * left most corner of the front guard(Skip List has front and rear guards, in this case, INT_MIN and
 * INT_MAX as the first and last values at each levels of the Skip List) and move towards the rear guard.
 * Duplicates are not allowed. Meaning, the program will not add values that already exist at that level.
 * Based on a random coin toss,a decision is made (50% chance) as to whether or not we insert a value at
 * a higher level. Values are sorted. */
